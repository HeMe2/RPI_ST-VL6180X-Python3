# Python 3 port of 310weber's ST VL6180X Python Library #

A python 3 port of the handy ST VL6180X library written by Arnie Weber. A test script to use the ST VL6180X time-of-flight (TOF) / ambient light sensor (ALS) with a Raspberry Pi is included in the test folder.

* Make sure you have i2c enabled and python-rpi.gpio installed on your raspberry pi.
* The VL6180X is a 2.8 V device - make sure you use a level shifter between the sensor and the 3.3 V Raspberry Pi GPIOs
